# Understanding Queue in Python

This repository provides a simple explanation and implementation of the **Queue** data structure using Python. It demonstrates the core operations and helps beginners understand how a queue works.

## What is a Queue?

A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO** (First In, First Out) principle.

**Real-life example:**  
Like a line at a ticket counter â€” the person who arrives first is served first.

## Operations Demonstrated

- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the end of the queue
- **Dequeue**: Remove the front element from the queue
- **Peek/Front**: View the front element without removing it
- **isEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty
- **Size**: Get the number of elements in the queue

## Implementation

Implemented using Python lists with custom logic for queue operations.
